(ns kmet.tasks.build
  "Build self-contained kmet executables (the babashka host's half of the
   `dist` task — `jolt dist` runs kmet.tasks.build-jolt instead).
   A binary is the official babashka release binary with target/kmet.jar (an
   uberjar of src + runtime deps) appended — babashka detects the appended zip
   at startup and runs the uberjar's -main (babashka wiki: Self-contained
   executable). One artifact per dist platform, laid out by the same scheme
   the jolt packager uses: a dist/kmet-<ver>-<platform>.zip holding one
   top-level folder — kmet-<ver>-<platform>/ with the bare kmet executable,
   its Termux launcher when one is written, and the repository LICENSE;
   cross-builds work from any host because packaging is just download + concat.

   Termux/Android: the glibc bb binary must be exec'd through the termux glibc
   dynamic linker, which also breaks bb's own appended-jar detection
   (/proc/self/exe resolves to ld-linux). For a termux host we therefore emit a
   companion launcher script that unsets LD_PRELOAD, execs via
   $PREFIX/glibc/lib/ld-linux-*.so.1 and passes --jar <self> explicitly.

   bb-only: the dist pipeline runs on babashka.classpath, which the jolt host
   does not provide — uberjar* and -main fail fast with ::bb-only under jolt,
   where the packager is kmet.tasks.build-jolt (jolt AOT-compiles instead of
   appending an uberjar). pack-extension! needs no
   classpath: it verifies and zips an artifact root through kmet.libs.archive,
   which runs on both hosts."

   kmet.tasks.build-jolt/-main)

   Build a self-contained kmet executable for each target platform: the
   official babashka release binary with an uberjar appended. Each build
   assembles the bare `kmet` (kmet.exe on Windows) under
   target/dist/<platform>/ and packages it as dist/kmet-<ver>-<platform>.zip
   with one top-level folder named after the zip (artifact-dir) holding the
   executable, its Termux launcher when one is written, and the repository
   LICENSE — so the executable carries no version while the zip name carries
   the version and the platform. --test swaps in the test-runner artifact
   instead: kmet-test and dist/kmet-test-<ver>-<platform>.zip, Main-Class
   kmet.tasks.test-main, whose
   --test/--test-ext flags run the packaged suite. Targets are dist
   platforms (linux-aarch64, linux-amd64, macos-aarch64, macos-amd64,
   windows-amd64; a release asset slug like linux-amd64-static is accepted
   too); they default to the current platform. --all builds every published
   platform, --force re-downloads cached babashka binaries, --out DIR
   additionally copies the executable into DIR, and --smoke runs the
   current-host artifact after building (--list-models plus --version, or
   the packaged test runner for --test; skipped by default to keep local
   dist builds fast and side-effect free). A fresh uberjar
   (target/kmet.jar, or target/kmet-test.jar for --test) is always rebuilt
   first so artifacts never bundle stale sources."
