(ns kmet.tasks.changed
  "Dev-loop helper backing the `bb changed` / `bb *-changed` tasks: finds
   changed files and computes, via the require graph, which namespaces are
   affected. Test namespaces map 1:1 to source namespaces (test/kmet/x/test_y.clj
   ↔ src/kmet/x/y.clj, and test/kmet/tasks/y_test.clj ↔ tasks/kmet/tasks/y.clj),
   so a source change must also re-run the tests that transitively require it.

   The source roots are src/, test/, tasks/ and extensions/ (see AGENTS.md
   § File layout — tasks/ holds the task implementations). Their files are
   listed gitignore-aware — git in a repo, a pruned walk otherwise (see
   project-files) — so a new root must be added to `source-roots` here.

   extensions/ is first-class: its .clj files (source and any tests they
   carry) are part of the lint/format gates and the changed-file scan, and
   join the require graph so contract changes pull them into the lint
   closure. Extension tests are separate projects though — they run from
   inside their own directory against their own deps, never via the root
   runner — so extension namespaces are excluded from root test selection.

   Change detection: git diff vs HEAD + untracked files when the project is a
   git repo; otherwise a mtime comparison against a baseline file written by
   the test gates (`bb test` / `bb test-ext`, when green and unfiltered)
   — everything newer than the last full test run counts as changed."
