  "The booted view: a ctx tree as text — `/units` and `--dump-state`.

   One renderer, two entry points: `units` renders the subtree of the ctx it is
   given, so `/units` inside an agent shows that agent and the flag shows the
   root. A command and a flag that compute a listing separately drift.

   One unit per line with no indentation (the path is in the line), parents
   before children and fibers in mount order — the two properties that made
   kmet1's store listing usable. A **ctx** line is a path and its child count; a
   **fiber** line is its state, what it injects, what it provides and its effect
   labels, plus the two facts a store could never show: `waiting-for` on a
   `:pending` fiber and the error on a `:failed` one.

   Every reading is the kernel's — `srce/children`, `srce/effects`, and the fiber
   record, which is the kernel's own inspection surface — so this namespace adds
   no kernel API. Nothing here prints a ctx or a value holding one: a ctx is
   cyclic, and a report names states, counts and service names."
