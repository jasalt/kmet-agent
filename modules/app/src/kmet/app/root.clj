   An atom rather than a delay because the entry that boots the composition
   (`bb start`) publishes *its* root here, so a process has one tree — the one
   it mounted. The first root wins; a test that publishes its own puts the
   previous one back (`reset-root!`/`restore-root!`) rather than clearing it,
   because the root carries the process's registrations.")

   reads. Returns the root in place.

   A caller publishes **before** anything reads a shim: otherwise the first
   reader boots a second composition behind the one the entry mounted, and
   kmet1's process-level code (the façades, the extension host's ctx-less
   reads, `/units`) sees a tree that is not the one the run is using. The
   first root wins — a second publish returns the root already in place rather
   than stranding a tree things are already reading. A process that runs a
   second entry in one image must `reset-root!` first; an entry is ordinarily a
   process, so nothing in the entry path does."
