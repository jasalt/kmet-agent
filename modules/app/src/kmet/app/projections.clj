  "The `:projections` service: derived state over a session log, incrementally.

   The log is append-only (`:sessions`), so everything an agent knows about its
   own past is a reading of it. This namespace is the reading that must not be
   recomputed per call:

   - **the inbox** — the messages queued for an agent's next turn
     (`:next-turn`, delivered after the run settles) or its next step
     (`:next-step`, injected between tool batches). The queue is *the log*, not
     a second in-memory list: enqueueing appends a fact, delivering appends the
     fact that consumes it, and the pending set is the fold of the two. That is
     the durability change this row carries — a queued message survives a
     restart because it was never only in memory.
   - **the turn boundaries** — the entries at which a turn ended (an assistant
     entry with no tool calls) and its outcome, so a front end or a wire client
     can resume from the last one instead of scanning the log.
   - **the token meter** — the usage totals over the branch, folded per entry
     (`kmet.ai.usage/entry-usage`'s normalized shape).

   **The fold is incremental, and the cache's key is the prefix.** A projection
   is built over the branch root→leaf (`kmet.agent.session.store/get-branch`),
   and the cache for a session remembers the entry it stopped at and how many it
   consumed. A branch that still *begins* with that fold continues from there —
   an append moves the leaf forward and keeps the prefix — while anything else
   (a branch switch, a fork arriving on another branch, a switch back past the
   cached length) starts over. The leaf id alone cannot be the key: every append
   moves it. `:extended` on the projection is how many entries this call folded,
   so the cache's behaviour is observable rather than assumed.

   **The two entry conventions are in this namespace, both directions.** An
   enqueue and a deliver are `:custom` entries with
   `:custom-type :queued-message` and an `:op` in `:data`; `:custom` is
   metadata to the context projection (`kmet.agent.session.context`) and never
   reaches the model, so the queue cannot leak into a prompt. The loop's own
   append of the delivered user message stays what it always was — the queue is
   the intent, the user entry is the delivery."
