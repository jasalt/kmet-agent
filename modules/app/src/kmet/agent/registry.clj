  "Name-addressed registrations behind one handle.

   Commands, prompt templates, skills and tools all register a value under a
   `[TAG name]` address, held by an owner, and answer the same questions: which
   value is `entry`'s for a name, what does the registry list (`entries`,
   `effective-entries`), what did one owner register (`by-owner`). Those rules
   live here once, over a **handle** — a value implementing `Registry`:

   - `atom-registry` — an atom of entries. What the app's `:tools` service
     installs: `register!` returns a disposer the caller ties to its fiber
     (`srce/effect`), so an extension's registrations unwind with it. It is the
     only handle: kmet1's scope-node store (`registry_store`) went with the
     store at landing 4e.

   The rules: an entry is addressed by its own name; owners are searched in
   display order, so the owner that took a name keeps it; `effective-entries`
   collapses the listing to one entry per name, so listing and lookup agree; a
   whole-registry clear removes by tag across every owner, because one owner
   holds several registries. The listing layout is the handle's (see
   `entries`).

   **Ownership is the address.** A registration's OWNER is a path —
   `[:app :tools]`, `[:app :commands]`, `[:app :extensions <name>]` — and
   nothing else has to exist for it to be addressable. An owner holds as many
   tags as it registers under, so unloading an extension is one
   `deregister-owner!` per tag rather than a disposer per name, and a name it
   took is the name it keeps until it unloads.

   The registries themselves stay in their namespaces: they own the tag, the
   domain validation and the owner default. Only the mechanics live here."
