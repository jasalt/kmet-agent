(ns kmet.libs.clipboard-win
  "Windows clipboard backend over the host FFI: CF_UNICODETEXT through
   OpenClipboard / EmptyClipboard / SetClipboardData, no subprocess.

   kmet.libs.clipboard resolves this namespace at call time and only on
   Windows, so a Unix host never loads it; user32 and kernel32 are loaded
   here, at namespace load. The host FFI — babashka.ffi (bundled in babashka,
   the standalone org.babashka/ffi on the JVM) or jolt.ffi — exposes the same
   FFM-style seam for everything used here. On the JVM the library needs
   JDK 22+ and native access (`:jvm` alias / the jar's Enable-Native-Access
   manifest attribute); a call site that cannot load it falls back to the
   platform tools. The one string-model difference is Jolt's: Jolt chars are
   code points, babashka/JVM chars are UTF-16 code units (see utf16-units)."
